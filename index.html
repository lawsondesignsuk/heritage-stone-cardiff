                    <p>"Was looking for a <strong>stone mason</strong>, had quite a few quotes, Heritage Stone was by far the best. I highly recommend this company. My neighbours will be using this company in the new year. This gentleman is extremely polite and professional, nothing is too much trouble, always turned up on time, even stayed late a number of evenings to make sure everything was left clean and tidy. A very respectful and professional company. Thank you Heritage Stone, you are a star!"</p>
